<h1>Challenge 3 - Americano Challenge</h1>
This individual challenge consisted of focusing on personal goals. </br>
My objectives were to learn more about design on sketch and working on accessibility features. </br>

<h1>The App</h1>
My idea is a diary app, that helps you track your emotions through time from the input of different entries throughout the day. </br>
It also gives you the option to switch to another tab, called the mindfulness view, where you can interact with the little app blob that gives you motivational senteces when triggered.</br>
Last but not least, there is also an option to lock in a Time capsule, which you can use to write an entry per year and it will then be locked until the year after, using it as a checkpoint on life progresses.
